# Explore London Travel Network
<br/><br/>

In this project, I worked with a slightly modified version of a dataset containing information about public transport journey volume by transport type.
The Mayor of London's office make their data available to the public [here](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset)
<br/><br/><br/>

## Objective
<br/><br/>

* Find most popular transport types.
<br/>
* Find the Emirates airline transport type popularity trend.
<br/>
* Find the least popular years of Underground & DLR transport type.
